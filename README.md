## Architecture

```
Client â†’ API Gateway â†’ [Auth Service]
                  â†˜ [Patient Service]
                  â†˜ [Billing Service]
                  â†˜ [Analytics Service] (optional)
```

* **API Gateway:** Entry point for all requests, handles routing and authorization
* **Auth Service:** Issues and validates JWTs
* **Patient Service:** Manages patient records
* **Billing Service:** Handles billing operations
* **Analytics Service:** Optional service for reports and metrics

## Setup & Installation

1. **Prerequisites**

   * Java 17+
   * Maven
   * PostgreSQL database
   * Docker (optional)

2. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritesh-7299/patient-management.git
cd patient-management
```

3. **Configure environment variables** in each serviceâ€™s `application.yml` or `application.properties` (database credentials, ports, JWT settings).

4. **Build and Run**

```bash
mvn clean install
# Example for running services:
cd api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
cd auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd patient-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```

5. **Test endpoints** using Postman, curl, or any REST client.

## Services & Endpoints

| Service         | Endpoint         | Method             | Description                    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Auth Service    | `/auth/login`    | POST               | Authenticate and obtain JWT    |
| Auth Service    | `/auth/validate` | GET                | Validate JWT token             |
| Patient Service | `/patients`      | GET / POST         | List all / create patient      |
| Patient Service | `/patients/{id}` | GET / PUT / DELETE | View / update / delete patient |
| Billing Service | `/billing`       | GET / POST         | Billing operations             |

---

## Security

* JWT-based authentication for all services
* API Gateway validates tokens before forwarding requests
* Role-based access control to restrict endpoints

---

## Configuration

Key configs are in each serviceâ€™s `application.yml` or `application.properties`:

* `server.port` for services
* Database connection settings
* `auth.service.url` for API Gateway
* JWT issuer / public key

---

## Roadmap / Future Work

* Move JWT validation in API Gateway to local signature verification
* Full role-based access control
* Add services for notifications, logging, and monitoring
* Implement retries and circuit breakers for resilience
* Docker / Kubernetes deployment
* Automated testing with coverage metrics
